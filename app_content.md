## NODE 1: What is a Function?
**Content:**
A function is a rule that assigns one output to each input. It shows how one variable depends on another.
Function models real-life problems by representing relationships between variables as equations.
* Input → independent variable (usually x)
* Output → dependent variable (usually y or f(x))

**Game (Yes/No):**
1. Each student is assigned one unique student number. Is this a function? (Answer: YES)
2. A person can have more than one email address. Is this a function? (Answer: NO)
3. Each day of the week has one assigned opening time for a store. Is this a function? (Answer: YES)
4. A phone number can belong to different people. Is this a function? (Answer: NO)
5. The number of hours worked determines exactly one salary amount. Is this a function? (Answer: YES)

## NODE 2: Piecewise Functions
**Content:**
A piecewise function is a function defined by more than one equation, where each equation applies to a specific interval or condition.
It is like a recipe with different instructions for different ingredients.

**Steps to Solve:**
1. Define variables.
2. Identify distinct scenarios (intervals).
3. Write a separate equation for each.
4. Combine into a single function f(x).

## NODE 3: Example 1 (Grab Cab)
**Problem:**
Minimum fare is Php 80.00 for the first 4 km. If distance exceeds 4 km, base fare is Php 40.00 plus Php 10.00 per km.

**Step-by-Step:**
* **Scenario 1 (0 < x ≤ 4):** Fare is fixed at Php 80.
* **Scenario 2 (x > 4):** Fare is 40 + 10x.
* **Function:** f(x) = { 80 if 0 < x ≤ 4; 40 + 10x if x > 4 }

## NODE 4: Example 2 (Delivery Service)
**Problem:**
Flat fee Php 50.00 within 3 km. If exceeds 3 km, fee is Php 20.00 plus Php 5.00 times the square of distance.

**Step-by-Step:**
* **Scenario 1 (0 < x ≤ 3):** f(x) = 50.
* **Scenario 2 (x > 3):** f(x) = 20 + 5x².
* **Function:** f(x) = { 50 if 0 < x ≤ 3; 20 + 5x² if x > 3 }
