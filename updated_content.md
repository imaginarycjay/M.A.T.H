## NODE 1: What is a Function?
**Type:** Lesson + Game

**Lesson Content:**
A function is a rule that assigns one output to each input. It shows how one variable depends on another.
Function models real-life problems by representing relationships between variables as equations.

**Key Points:**
* **Input:** independent variable (usually x)
* **Output:** dependent variable (usually y or f(x))
* **Remember:** Each input must have exactly ONE output for it to be a function!

**Example:**
If a number of hours worked affects salary, then salary depends on hours worked.
* **Analysis:** Since the salary depends on hours worked, we assume that **x (independent variable) = hours worked**, and **y (dependent variable) = salary**.

**Game (Is it a Function?):**
*Direction: Click Yes if it is a function and No otherwise.*

1.  **Question:** Each student is assigned one unique student number.
    * **Answer:** YES
    * **Explanation:** Each input (student) has exactly one output (student number).
2.  **Question:** A person can have more than one email address.
    * **Answer:** NO
    * **Explanation:** This means the input (person) does not just have one output (email).
3.  **Question:** Each day of the week has one assigned opening time for a store.
    * **Answer:** YES
    * **Explanation:** Each input (day) has exactly one output (opening time).
4.  **Question:** A phone number can belong to different people.
    * **Answer:** NO
    * **Explanation:** This means the phone number (input) can give different outputs (people).
5.  **Question:** The number of hours worked determines exactly one salary amount.
    * **Answer:** YES
    * **Explanation:** Each input (hours) has exactly one output (salary).

## NODE 2: Piecewise Functions
**Type:** Lesson Only

**Lesson Content:**
**Multiple rules, one function.**
A piecewise function is a function defined by more than one equation, where each equation applies to a specific interval or condition.

**Think of it like:** A recipe with different instructions for different ingredients!

**Steps in Solving a Piecewise Function:**
1.  Define variables.
2.  Identify the distinct scenarios (intervals).
3.  Write an equation for each scenario.
4.  Substitute the given values into a piecewise function.
5.  Solve.

**Real-Life Examples:**
* Taxi fares that change after certain distances.
* Delivery fees based on distance.
* Phone plans with different rates.

## NODE 3: Example 1 (Grab Cab)
**Type:** Example + Mini Quiz

**Problem:**
The minimum fare for a regular grab cab is Php 80.00 for the first 4 km. If the distance exceeds 4 km, the base fare is Php 40.00 plus Php 10.00 for every kilometer. Construct a function that would represent the fare of the passenger given the distance travelled.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**
1.  **Define Variables:**
    * Let x = distance traveled (Input)
    * Let f(x) = fare of the passenger (Output)
2.  **Identify Scenarios:**
    * Scenario 1: If 0 < x ≤ 4, Fare is fixed at Php 80.00.
    * Scenario 2: If x > 4, Base fare is Php 40 plus Php 10 for every km.
3.  **Write Equations:**
    * Scenario 1: f(x) = 80
    * Scenario 2: f(x) = 40 + 10x
4.  **Final Piecewise Function:**
    * f(x) = { 80 if 0 < x ≤ 4 ; 40 + 10x if x > 4 }
